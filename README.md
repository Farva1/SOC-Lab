# SOC-Lab-Splunk
Threat hunting using Splunk with Apache logs (404 errors, suspicious IPs, alerts, dashboard).

## Project Overview
This lab was based on Splunk Enterprise and involved uploading Apache web server logs, search, alerts, and development of SOC dashboard. It was intended to train on the log analysis, threat hunting, and alerting, which are valuable skills of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst.

## Steps I Did
**1. Setup Splunk & Add Data**

- Logged into my local Splunk instance (localhost:8000).

- Uploaded the file apachelogs.txt.
- Selected the source type as accesscombined so Splunk could understand the log format.
